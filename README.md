# MIMIC Critical Care Datathon

These are training materials for the MIMIC Critical Care Datathon at Mozfest 2015. 

## What is MIMIC-III?

MIMIC-III is an freely available dataset developed by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology, comprising deidentified health data associated with >40,000 critical care patients. It includes demographics, vital signs, laboratory tests, medications, and more. For further information, see: https://mimic.physionet.org/

## Workshop overview 

During the workshop, you will:

- Learn about MIMIC-III, the publicly accessible critical care database 
- Create a local version of MIMIC-III with a small sample of patients using the Firefox SQLite Plugin
- Explore the patient data using SQL
- Plot and analyse the data using Python
- Get inspiration for future research projects

## Downloading the materials

If you are familiar with git, please clone this repository. If not, click the
'Download ZIP' button on the right and then unzip the materials onto your
computer.

## Installing SQLite Manager and IPython Notebook

To create the database on your computer, you will need the Firefox SQLite Manager Add-on. Open Firefox, select "Add-ons" from the Tools menu, and then install SQLite Manager.

To analyse the data using IPython Notebook:
- If you already have Python and the Pip package manager, run ```pip install ipython```
- If you are new to Python, we suggest installing the Anaconda package from https://www.continuum.io/downloads. Then run ```conda update ipython```.

## Getting access to the full MIMIC-III dataset

If after this workshop you would like to gain access to the full MIMIC-III dataset, which contains rich data for over 40,000 patients, please see: https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/
